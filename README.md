# Freelance-Job-Marketplace-A1P3
Working as a freelancer has become an easy task these last few years. Previously the most difficult challenge was to find your first job or project. But now, this has become possible with a simple registration to a freelance jobs marketplace. Companies can increase their productivity by hiring skills in any field and anywhere in the world. And young freelancers can find their projects most easily. The new freelance job marketplaces offer more than just finding jobs or projects. They provide tools for accounting, managing contracts and money delivery. Some platforms even use artificial intelligence algorithms to find the best matching between offers and demands. These platforms have become a great place to build a freelancer career and a business support tool to remove borders and barriers.
